In this project I've developed a Java desktop application named as "Messenger" which uses Swing and AWT packages for graphics and JDBC for connecting to MySQL database.

Features-

1. Messages are encrypted using symmetric encryption before storing on database.

2. Messages are permanently stored on database  So no local memory is used.

3. Username and password are required for logging into application.( authentication through database)

4. Currently only group messaging is available.

Note: JRE is required to run **Messenger.exe** & path of JRE should be added to environment variable named as **PATH** <br />
                    OR   <br />
open the **Code** folder in Eclipse and directly run the file **LoginPage.java**

Also use 
Username= **user1** OR **user2** OR **user3** <br />
Password= **password**
